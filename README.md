# Advanced Application Delivery & Security (Citrix NetScaler)

### 🔍 Specialized Focus
This repository documents my methodologies for managing and securing application traffic using the **Citrix NetScaler (ADC)** stack in complex, high-availability environments.

### 🛠️ Advanced Implementations
* **Identity & Access:** Configuring secure remote access via **NetScaler Gateway**, including **ICA Proxy**, **nFactor Authentication**, and **SAML/Okta** integration.
* **Application Security:** Deploying **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** policies to mitigate OWASP vulnerabilities and protect critical web assets.
* **Cloud & Hybrid:** Managing NetScaler instances across **Azure, AWS, and GCP**, fully integrated with **Citrix Cloud** and **Citrix ADM**.
* **Traffic Management:** Implementing GSLB for global redundancy, advanced **SSL Offloading**, and performing deep **AppFW** troubleshooting.

### ⚡ Troubleshooting Framework
- **Deep Trace Analysis:** Correlating Fiddler (HAR) files with server-side `tcpdump` and **Wireshark** traces to resolve complex HTTP/SSL handshake issues.
- **Service Integration:** Troubleshooting end-to-end connectivity between NetScaler, **StoreFront**, and **Citrix Virtual Apps & Desktops**.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Delivering comprehensive technical post-mortems for "War Room" scenarios and high-priority accounts.
