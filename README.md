# Citrix NetScaler ADC & Gateway Administration

### 🔍 Project Overview
This repository documents my technical methodologies for managing and troubleshooting Citrix NetScaler (formerly Citrix ADC) platforms, including **VPX, SDX, MPX, and ADM**. My focus is on ensuring high availability, security, and optimized application delivery for enterprise environments.

### 🛠️ Core Competencies & Implementation
* **Load Balancing & Content Switching:** Expert in configuring virtual servers to distribute traffic efficiently and using Content Switching for granular traffic management.
* **Policy Management:** Hands-on experience creating and deploying **Rewrite and Responder Policies** to manipulate headers and control traffic flow.
* **Security & WAF:** Implementing **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to protect against L7 attacks and managing **NetScaler Gateway** for secure remote access.
* **SSL & Encryption:** Managing SSL offloading, certificate bindings, and secure communication protocols.

### 📈 High-Impact Troubleshooting
* **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Specializing in delivering detailed RCAs for "Red Accounts" by analyzing system logs and packet traces.
* **Packet Trace Analysis:** Using **Wireshark** to diagnose complex network issues such as TCP handshake failures, SSL mismatches, and header insertion errors.
* **High Availability (HA):** Configuring and troubleshooting HA pairs to ensure zero downtime for critical business applications.
